// Ques 2. Print all odd numbers between 1 and n, inclusive. Odd numbers are
integers that are not divisible by 2. These numbers should be printed in
ascending order, separated by spaces.
This problem is a simple introduction to loops and conditional checks. The
goal is to use a loop to iterate over the numbers and check if they are odd
using the condition i%2â‰ 0.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
int n;
cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
cin >> n;
if (n > 0) {
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
if (i % 2 != 0) {
cout << i << " ";
}
}
cout << endl;
} 
else {
cout << "Please enter a positive integer." << endl;
}
return 0;
}
